# Week 5 - Day 4

## Advanced Prep

Tomorrow's huddle will be about Test Driven Development.

Read through this tutorial, [Learn TDD in React](https://learntdd.in/react) to get an overview of the topic.

You can _try_ the tutorial if you'd like, but note that it hasn't been updated for React 18. However, the principles remain the same.

## Hour 1

* Review
* Show'n'Tell'Debug

## Hour 2

* Mood Ring + [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* Time Permitting: [React Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#step-1-create-the-context)

## Recommended Reading

* [OverReacted: A complete guide to `useEffect`](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)
* [React.dev: Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Patrick Roza: Component vs Prop drilling in React](https://patrickroza.com/blog/component-vs-prop-drilling-in-react/)

## NOTE

There are a _lot_ of good links in the [Resources](./RESOURCES.md) file today! I would read as many of those as you can (and note any particular questions that come to mind).

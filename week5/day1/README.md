REACT!

**Read this first!** -> * [Create-React-App Evolution (Bitsrc.io)](https://blog.bitsrc.io/the-future-of-react-why-create-react-app-is-deprecated-and-hooks-are-the-future-83e8a087a325)

**NOTE** React has changed quite a bit recently, i.e. a fairly drastic change in the last year.

Time permitting: We'll setup [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about) using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

(If you have `brew` installed, this is another way to try to install `nvm` [NVM](https://collabnix.com/how-to-install-and-configure-nvm-on-mac-os/))

## Application Architecture

We're moving from simple DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests into _more complex_ DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests. ðŸ˜‰

Notably, we're moving in the realm of "Single Page Applications" aka "SPA."

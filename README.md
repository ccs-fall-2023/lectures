# Lectures for Carolina Code School Fall 2023

Every week will have a folder that contains lessons for each day that week, as well as any general information about the week's topics.

---

The folder structure will roughly follow this pattern:

- `README.md` - Description of the week's topics
- Day Folder `day [number]`
  - `README.md`
    - Links to presentations
    - Helpful/relevant resources for deeper dives
    - Links to recommended reading (optional)
    - Topic keywords (optional)
  - `EXERCISES.md`
    - Various exercises related to the topic of the day
  - `RESOURCES.md`
    - Extra reading, practice, general topics
    - Resources folder (optional)

---

There might be other related files in any given day for extra reading, practice, etc... In general, most will follow the above pattern.

**NOTE:** Documents will be published the morning of each day. This is by design, I'll explain why in class. ðŸ˜„

# Lectures for Carolina Code School Fall 2023

This is your field guide to your Full Time Web Development cohort, and should provide you with information you need about what to expect in class week to week.

---

## Lectures

Your lectures will be published in weekly folders inside the `lectures` directory. Each week will contain:

- `README.md` - An overview about what to expect that week, including any recommended preparation
- `day-*` directories - Each day of your class will contain
  - `README.md` - An agenda for the day and any relevant scheduling information
  - `EXERCISES.md` - A link to the exercises for a particular day (could be Learning Portal or external)
  - `RESOURCES.md` - Additional resources that may be relevant to the day's lecture (if applicable)
  - `/resources` - Occasionally we'll include some helpful files here (screenshots, PDFs, etc...)

---

There might be other related files in any given day for extra reading, practice, etc... In general, most will follow the above pattern.

**NOTE:** Documents will be published the morning of each day. This is by design, I'll explain why in class. ðŸ˜„

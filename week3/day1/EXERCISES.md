## jQuery Refactor

* [jQuery to JS Converstion Exercise](https://github.com/ccs-fall-2023/exercises/tree/main/js-jquery-conversion)

### Notes about the refactor

* Your goal is to completely remove jQuery (check the `script` tags!).
* Update all the code to work with just plain JS.
* You might need to lookup some of the jQuery methods to see what the closest event/behavior/etc... is likely to be in JS.
* However, you _might_ be able to infer the behavior based on the interface.
* This will come in handy with regard to the `audio` element: [The Embed Audio element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio)

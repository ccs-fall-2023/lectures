## HTML

* [Adam Silver - 7 Pillars of Form Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rm7JCcCcvgdaAQnlNSBgW4FIdPWBHU7U__pKbhaaHu8/edit?usp=sharing)
  I don't agree 100% with all of these, but overall these are all well thought out. If you only ever stuck to these 7 rules, you wouldn't go wrong.

## JavaScript

* [Replacing jQuery with Vanilla ES6](https://aarontgrogg.com/blog/2021/09/29/replacing-jquery-with-vanilla-es6/)
* [The Promise JS Explained in Burger Party](https://fullstackjournal.wordpress.com/2018/07/06/the-promise-js-explained-i-burger-party/)
* [10 JavaScript Array methods to simplify your code.](https://denic.hashnode.dev/10-javascript-array-methods-to-simplify-your-code)
* [Callback vs Promises vs Async Await](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/callback-vs-promises-vs-async-await/)<br/>We haven't covered `async`/`await` yet, but this is both a solid review of Callbacks and Promises, and a nice intro to `async`/`await` (we'll get to them during Backend).

## General

* [A New JavaScript Compiler Aims to Improve Chromeâ€™s Overall Speed](https://www.reviewgeek.com/85610/a-new-javascript-compiler-aims-to-improve-chromes-overall-speed/)<br/>Good reminder that this is all _still_ very much in process as we speak.
* [Wordpress Turns 18](https://ma.tt/2021/05/wordpress-18/)<br/>This makes me feel _old_ (older than I usually do).

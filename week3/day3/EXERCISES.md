# Exercises

## JS Array Practice

* Continue the [Array Practice](https://github.com/ccs-fall-2023/exercises/tree/main/js-array-practice) from yesterday.
  * **NOTE** I updated the original repo and moved the `exercises.js` into its own repo.

## SPACE WARS AND LASER SWORDS

* Use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation) to create site.


### Padawan to Jedi

* Have a form to accept user input.
* Perform a search of API data based on that input.
* Filter out data from a response based on user input, update the DOM accordingly.

### Jedi to Jedi Master

* Have a user "submit" a question to a character and return and answer.
* Example questions might be: "What is your homeworld?" or "What ship do you pilot?"

* Utilize at least __TWO__ endpoints, and they should be different than the ones you used previously.
* Combine the data from these endpoints to generate a single page.

* Perform a search of API data based on that input.
* Filter out data from a response based on user input, update the DOM accordingly.

### Jedi to Jedi Master

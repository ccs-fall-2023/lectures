# Patterns to remember the first 2 weeks

1. **Imperative programming** is writing code that tells the computer _how_ to do something.
    * Boiled down to its essence, think of it like this:
    > "Hey, Computer, if a user gives you value [x] then perform action [y]."
2. **Variables** are basically placeholders for data.
3. **Functions** are like "programs within a program." Think of them like a recipe, or list of steps. Their superpower is the ability to break up a large program into smaller, re-usable, chunks.
    * “Create one object that can spawn many”

## Types

### Primitive Data Types

* Strings - any kind of characters in quotes
  * `"This is 1 single string, it's in quotes."`
* Integer - numbers, no quotes
  * `1`
* Boolean
  * `True` or `False`


## Loops

* A `for` loop will loop over each item in a collection of items.
* A `while` loop will loop over items until a condition is no longer `True`

## Functions

A function will have **four** key parts:

1. The function keyword
2. A unique name (make it descriptive!)
3. Parentheses, `()`, follow the name and can accept parameters (if needed!)
4. The function body, which will `return` a value
<!--
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

* A class will act like a blueprint/template/factory.
* A class will contain attributes and applicable methods.
* Classes have a _"constructor"_ method that defines how new objects are create.
* Objects created using a class are called **instances**
* Objects will inherit attributes and methods from their class.
* Classes can inherit properties from "parent" or "super" classes.

In general, a `class` will have the following key parts:

1. The `class` keyword
2. A unique, _Capitalized_ name (make it descriptive!)
3. A constructor function
4. Attributes: What can _instances_ of the class **HAVE**?
5. Methods: What can _instances_ of the class **DO**? -->

> Django is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt), a jazz manouche guitarist from the 1930s to early 1950s. To this day, he’s considered one of the best guitarists of all time.

This FAQ article explains the Djangon perspective on MVC vs MVT: [Django appears to be a MVC framework, but you call the Controller the “view”, and the View the “template”.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names)

## MVC + Django = Backend Web Development

Per the documentation:

> Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

Read [the overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/overview/) to get a deeper insight into what Django offers.

### Hard Mode vs Easy Mode, You Decide

> Your position determines if you're playing on easy mode or hard more.
>
> Many people unintentionally choose to play on hard mode by not sleeping enough, not eating healthy food, or not investing in their most important relationships.
>
> You can't remove struggle or emotion from life, but you can put yourself in a position where they don't control you.
>
> Consistently doing the simplest things makes the biggest difference.


### Consistency >>>> Talent

> Talent and potential mean nothing if you can't consistently do the boring things when you don't feel like doing them.

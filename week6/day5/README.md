# Week 6 - Day 5

The post-Grok hangover.

## Teach a Thing

In place of Show'n'Tell'Debug, we're going to do Shown'n'Teach!

On _Monday_ (10/09) you will be required to teach the class on an assigned topic.  We'll dedicate the first 90 minutes of the day to these lessons (there is a time limit!).

### Requirements

* Each presentation must be at _least_ 15 minutes long, but can go a maximum of 20 minutes.
* Each presentation must involve a code demo.
* It is recommended, but not required, that you include the class as much as possible.
* Be prepared for follow up questions from the class.

For your topic, answer the following questions:

1. What is it?
2. How does it work?
3. Why is it important?

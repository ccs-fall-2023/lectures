# Week 6 - Day 3

It's Grok Eve y'all!

## Hour 1

Shown'n'Tell'n'Debug

## Remix JS

Next week we'll be getting into Python, and then Django. We'll use Remix as a "bridge" between our familiarity with frontend/client-side technology and backend/server-side technology.

From [Remix.run](https://remix.run)

> Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.

Large portions of Remix are _just_ React-Router. You can read more about that here: [Discussions: React Router](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/react-router)

> Remix is built on top of React Router and maintained by the same team. This means that you can use all the features of React Router in your Remix app.
>
> This also means that the 90% of Remix is really just React Router: a very old, very stable library that is perhaps the largest dependency in the React ecosystem. Remix simply adds a server behind it.

You'll notice that the [Remix setup tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial) will look _very_ familiar.

This should sound familiar, or at least have some familiar terminology (emphasis added)

> Remix turns browser functionality into an efficient web development tool, utilizing classic standards and web fundamentals for crafting HTML forms. When building a remix app, the ***“action”*** and ***“loader”*** functions, Remix handles everything.

# Week 6 - More React + GROK

- It's GROK week!!
- IT'S SPOOKY SEASON!! ðŸŽƒ ðŸ‘» ðŸ’€
  - Keep me honest, for October I'll wear a _different_ "spooky" themed shirt every day of class.
  - It's your job to let me know if I repeat!
- We'll spend most of the week working with additional React Libraries
  - React Router
  - React Context API
- Time permitting, we'll look at React-based frameworks like NextJS and/or RemixJS

Alex Martin, CTO of Build Carolina, will be here on Wednesday.

Thursday is [GROK](https://grokconf.com/). Use this time to listen to great talks, and meet with other industry folks. I've not been to GROK before, but I've been told it's a fantastic, free-flowing, type of conference.

I will also be at the conference on Friday, but will try to check in after you're done with your Friday morning huddle.

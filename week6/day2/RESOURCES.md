> The first thing to be aware of is the presence of a handful of new Data APIs that only work on routes defined via the new data routers (i.e., createBrowserRouter). These include a few categories of APIs:
> * Route-level data APIs such as loader, action, shouldRevalidate, handle, and lazy
> * In-component data hooks such as useLoaderData, useActionData, useFetcher, useMatches, useNavigation, etc.
> * Error-handling APIs such as route.errorElement, route.ErrorBoundary, and useRouteError
>
>The rest of the APIs that existed prior to v6.4.0 are still usable in both BrowserRouter and RouterProvider apps. These include common hooks/components such as useNavigate, useLocation, useParams, <Link>, <Outlet />, etc.

This is new with the current version of React Router (v6.4):

* [React Router v6: `createBrowserRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router)

> This is the recommended router for all React Router web projects. It uses the DOM History API to update the URL and manage the history stack.
> It also enables the v6.4 data APIs like loaders, actions, fetchers and more.

If you look at tutorials from _before_ v6.4, this will likely be the biggest difference.

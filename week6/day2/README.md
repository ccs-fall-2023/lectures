# Week 6 - Day 2

## Hour 1

All.the.questions!! Let's answer 'em!

(Also, y'all are going to [help _me_ debug!](https://github.com/seanrreid/react-router-v6.4_CCS_11-2023))

## Hour 2

Code along! We'll be referencing our [Github Issues API exercise](https://github.com/ccs-fall-2023/exercises/tree/main/js-github-fetch#github-issues-lookup), but starting over with React Router.

### Hacktoberfest

* [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/), go hack away on something you think sounds cool!

### We _do_ talk about Bruno!

* [Bruno, a new and innovative open source API client](https://www.usebruno.com/)  This is basically like Postman, but entirely local and Open Source.

### React Router v6
React Router v6 introduces more than a few changes over v5 (and v5 had a _lot_ of big changes over v4).

[Log Rocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/migrating-react-router-v6-guide/#change-react-router-v6) does a great job looking into these changes, with some history around the benefits/drawbacks of the different apporoaches.

> React Router v5 came close to perfection, but there were still some flaws. The v5 library has some issues with the routing algorithm and routing configuration defaults (JSX component prop defaults). Also, the v5 came with some inconsistent, somewhat complex APIs that affect the developer’s productivity. Moreover, v5’s bundle size weighs more compared to what it offers as a React library.

Log Rocket also goes into the [benefits of v6 over v5](https://blog.logrocket.com/migrating-react-router-v6-guide/#benefits-react-router-v6-over-v5).

# Week 6 - Day 1

## Hour 1

- Shown'n'Tell'Debug

## Hours 2 - 3

- Let's talk about [Optional Chaining](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-optional-chaining/), [Nullish Coalescing](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-nullish-coalescing/), and the [Ternary Operator](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-ternary-operator/)
- Using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to browse Github issues.

## Well, this is confusing as hell

- Old React says: [If-Else in JSX](https://react-cn.github.io/react/tips/if-else-in-JSX.html)
    > if-else statements don't work inside JSX. This is because JSX is just syntactic sugar for function calls and object construction.
- But new React says: [Conditional Rendering](https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering)
    > Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.

# Week 9 - Day 1

Here we go, last week of instruction!!

There won't be as many resources/exercises this week. Our primary focus for the week will be building out a feature complete full-stack app.
We're going to act like we're an agency and have been tasked to build an app for a client.

Welcome to CRUDCo, Inc! Let's build rad stuff!

## Hour 1

- Let's talk all things JWT (we'll be doing more JWT this week).
- Register for an account on [Render.com](https://dashboard.render.com/).
    This will be needed to deploy later.

## Hours 2-3

Let's build some CRUD!

CRUDCo Inc has been hired to write a URL shortening service for a client.

### Requirments

- Users can submit a long URL.
- URLs are saved in a database.
- Unique IDs are generated for each URL.
- The short url is available via a list when a user logs in.

### To discuss

- What relationships do we need to create (aka "What is our schema?")?
- What is our Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
- What are all the parts we'll need to build out the MVP?

# Week 9 - Day 3

> "I hope you're proud of yourself for the times you've said 'yes,' when all it meant was extra work for you and was seemingly helpful only to someone else." â€” Fred Rogers.

## Today's Goals

OH, BTW, [here are the details for the final project!](../../final-project/README.md)

### Review

* Code Review
  * What worked?
  * Where are you stuck?

  * Verify migrations
* Test our API to add/update URLs via POSTMan
* Add in JWT and Authentication
* Protect `POST` requests
* Protect `GET` requests as well? Or allow "read only?"

* Let's add some user and data!
* Prepare for some design work on the frontend

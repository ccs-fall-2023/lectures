# Week 9 - Day 4

ARE WE THERE YET???

## Today's Goals

We're coming up on the end of the CRUDCo URL Shortening App.

Oh, and it's PICTURE DAY! SMILE! 📷 😁 📷

### Review

* Code Review
  * What worked?
  * Where are you stuck?
* Checked our Models
* Tested our API to add/update URLs via POSTMan
* Added in JWT and Authentication
* Protected `POST` requests
* Protected `GET` requests as well? Or allow "read only?"
* Added some users and data!
* Built the frontend
* Built forms to login
* Built forms to submit a new URL

### New Features

* Handle the _actual_ redirection!
* Handle getting the user information we need from "Simple" JWT 😂
* Let's talk about Protected Routes (and why they're super confusing!) 🥴
* Let's talk about context!

# Week 4 - Day 5

It's a Friday Huddle day!

## Journals

* We're at the end of Week 4, make a new entry in your journal repo (or file).  Reflect back on where you are now, what you've learned, and what excites (or scares) you for the upcoming 2 weeks.

## Food for thought

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

-- [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Galls_law)

## Helpful Resources

* [Speeding Up the JavaScript Ecosystem](https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem/)
  This is a multipart series about potential improvements across the entire ecosystem. A lot of this will be more advanced than were we are currently, but it's worth a read to judge the scale of JavaScript development today.  (it's also somewhat relevent re: Gall's Law above)
* [When to Loop? When to Recurse?](https://betterprogramming.pub/when-to-loop-when-to-recurse-b786ad8977de)
  This question plagues me any time I need to work with complex data. Thankfully, those times have been somewhat rare ðŸ˜‚

## OOP Warrior Exercises

Here comes a curveball...

* What if, instead of "hero" and "villain" _person_, they were cars competing in a race?
* Do you go more [_Fast and Furious_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious)?
* Perhaps [_Death Race 200_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Race_2000)?

If you're finished with warriors, make a new version (new folder, new repo) that is vehicle based.

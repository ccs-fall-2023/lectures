### Ask Me Anything

Next week we'll start working in [React](https://react.dev/learn).  There is a lot to this framework, it's very powerful and popular (and those things are _mostly_ correlated).

Before we jump into that, it's important that we address any lingering questions/misunderstandings. Therefore, today is dedicated to "Ask Me Anything!"

Whatever questions you have, let's figure them out together!

## Good Advice for Forward Progress:

> When you focus on the outcome, the gap between where you are and where you want to go seems large. To cover ground quickly, the tendency is to look for a hack or shortcut.
> The problem is that no one who got the outcomes you wanted used a hack or shortcut to get them. Instead, they consistently inched forward.
> Instead of focusing on the ultimate outcome, focus on the next move. There is always something you can do today to get a little better, to move a little closer, to put yourself in a better position. It's not pretty. It's not sexy. It's not fast. It doesn't even make for a good story. But it works.
> You don't build an empire in a day. You build it brick by brick. Day by day.
> Consistent daily progress for a long period of time.

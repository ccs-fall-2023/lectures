# Patterns to remember the first 2 weeks

1. **Imperative programming** is writing code that tells the computer _how_ to do something.
    > "Hey, Computer, if a user gives you value [x] then perform action [y]."
2. **Decalartive programming** is writing code that tell the computer _what_ you want to see.
   > "Hey, Computer, this content needs to look like this..."
3. **Variables** are basically placeholders for data.
4. **Functions** are like "programs within a program." Think of them like a recipe, or list of steps. Their superpower is the ability to break up a large program into smaller, re-usable, chunks.
    * “Create one object that can spawn many”

## Types

### Primitive Data Types

* Strings - any kind of characters in quotes
  * `"This is 1 single string, it's in quotes."`
* Integer - numbers, no quotes
  * `1`
* Boolean
  * `True` or `False`


## Loops

* A `for` loop will loop over each item in a collection of items.
* A `while` loop will loop over items until a condition is no longer `True`

## Functions

A function will have **four** key parts:

1. The function keyword
2. A unique name (make it descriptive!)
3. Parentheses, `()`, follow the name and can accept parameters (if needed!)
4. The function body, which will `return` a value

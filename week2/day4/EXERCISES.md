# Exercises

## Continue working on [building a site from a Mockup](https://github.com/ccs-fall-2023/exercises/tree/main/fe-dribbble)

* Most Dribbble shots only show a homepage. Based on the design you chose, what would interior pages (i.e. Contact page, About Us page) look like?
* You can choose to make other pages in their own folders, i.e. `/about-us/index.html`, or you can just make a top-level html file that resides in the same folder as `index.html`, i.e. `about-us.html`.  You decide!
* Link to your interior pages from the navigation on your homepage.
* Make sure this navigation is reflected on all other pages, and make sure there's a link to the "home" page._

## General Reminders

### ❗ MAKE FREQUENT COMMITS ❗

* As you make changes make sure you:
  * `git add` the new/changed files
  * `git commit` the changes

### ❗ MAKE SURE TO PUSH YOUR WORK UP TO GITHUB ❗

* Create a Github repo
* Connect your local repo to the remote repo
* Push up your work (`main` branch or any others you might have used)

## Journaling

It's been two weeks since you started this journey. It's a good time to reflect on where you were, where you are, and how you feel about where you're going.

* Create a local folder, initialize a git repo, and make a file called `week2.md`.
* In this markdown file, write about your experience up to this point.
* Here's a starter topic idea: _Describe your experience using the internet before this class. Research? Blogs? Social Media? Then describe how you think your usage might change after taking the class_.
* Make sure to add a repo to Github and push up your files!

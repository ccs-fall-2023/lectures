## Helpful Resources, aka "WTF QUOTES??"

Inspired by [Val's Question #get-help](https://carolinacodeschool.slack.com/archives/C05MR1ZEBC3/p1697069567798859)

* [Stack Overflow: What is the difference between single quotes and double quotes in PostgreSQL?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41396195/what-is-the-difference-between-single-quotes-and-double-quotes-in-postgresql)
* [Prisma.io: How to use single and double quotes in PostgreSQL](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/short-guides/quoting-rules)
* [Don‚Äôt use double quotes in PostgreSQL](https://lerner.co.il/2013/11/30/quoting-postgresql/)</br>
  > Single quotes and double quotes in PostgreSQL have completely different jobs, and return completely different data types.  Single quotes return text strings.  Double quotes return (if you can really think of them as ‚Äúreturning‚Äù anything) identifiers, but with the case preserved.

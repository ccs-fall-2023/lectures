## Python OOP

* [Real Python: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
* [r/learnpython on Reddit:No need for classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1309i1n/no_need_for_classes/)

* [VeryAcademy on YouTube: Python OOP for Django Class Based Views Explained - Beginners guide to OOP and using Django Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBWiQMHcSQk)
* [Built an App with Object-Oriented an SOLID principles Using Django](https://haddad-tech.medium.com/built-an-app-with-object-oriented-an-solid-principles-using-django-39ce842d5904)
